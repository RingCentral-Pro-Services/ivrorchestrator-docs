The **Media datatable** shows all prompt media files found in your [RingCentral®](https://ringcentral.com) account. Media refers to the actual audio files that callers hear when interacting with an IVR. The datatable displays information about each media file, if it has been selected for use, what it is scheudled for, and if it is a media file generated by the [IVR Orchestrator](https://ivrorchestrator.ps.ringcentral.com) or not.

This section is fully integrated to the media library in your RingCentral account:

* Media imported into this application will appear in the RingCentral account media library.
* Media added directly to the RingCentral account media library will appear in this application.
* Deleted media will be removed from both this app and the RingCentral Office account media library.

Any media that is present can be used for orchestration activities across a single or multiple IVR prompts.

*When visiting the Media section, it might take up to one minute to load the media files found in your [RingCentral®](https://ringcentral.com) account.*

## Columns
* **Name-** the name of this media file. *Click on the name of a IVR to edit its prompt media.*
* **In Use-** the IVRs that currently use this media file as prompt media.
* **Scheduled For-** the IVRs that currently use this media file as scheduled prompt media.
* **System Generated-** is the media file generated by the IVR Orchestrator.

## Sorting
By default the data is sorted by the **Name** value in a descending order. To change the sort order of a column click the name of the column you would like to sort. It will cycle through the following options:

* **Descending-** first click
* **Ascending-** second click
* **Default-** third click

## Overflow Menu
Only rows of generated media files or files imported with IVR Orchestrator will have an overflow icon ( ![Overflow Icon](../assets/overflow-icon.svg "Overflow Icon") ) that, when clicked, will open up a dropdown menu with the following options:

* **Remove From All IVRs-** remove the selected file from all IVRs where it is selected as prompt media or scheduled as prompt media.
* **Delete Media-** delete the media file and remove it from your RingCentral account. *If the media file is in use when trying to delete it, the system will ask if you want to remove it from the IVRs in which it is being used before deleting the file.* 

*The overflow menu is a shortcut, the same options are available as datatable actions above the datatable.*

## Pagination
At the bottom of the datatable are the pagination elements. To the left is the **page selection** that allows you to select a page and to the right are the **rows per page** and **total entries**.
