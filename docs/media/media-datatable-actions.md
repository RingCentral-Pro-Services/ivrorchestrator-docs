The **Media datatable actions** are the primary way to interact with the prompt media found in your account. The actions can be found directly above the datatable. *Some actions can be engaged immediately but the **Delete** action requires selecting the checkbox(es) next to the row item before it will become available:*

## Import
Import new prompt media files. The system accepts .mp3 and .wav files and these will also be available in your RingCentral account.

Learn more about[Importing New Media](media/import-new-media).

## Delete
Permanently delete the prompt media file(s) from IVR Orchestrator and your RingCentral account.

*This action cannot be undone. Make sure you no longer want the media in your account before deleting it.*

## Reloads
The Reload icon ( ![Reload icon](../assets/restart.svg "Reload icon") )will pull all IVR datatable details and associated prompt media data found in your [RingCentralÂ®](https://ringcentral.com) account. Use the reload option to load new IVR data after you make changes in the RingCentral admin portal.

## Tune 
The Tune icon ( ![Tune icon](../assets/tune.svg "Tune icon") ) allows you to toggle on and off the Applied Media, Ext and Site columns from being shown in the datatable. Use this feature to de-clutter your view when you are using the Optional Naming Convention feature to include custom datatable columns.

## Export
The export icon ( ![Export icon](../assets/export.svg "Export icon") ) will export all entries in the datatable to .xlsx file format. *Alternatively, you can select the checkbox(es) next to the row item(s) to export only the selected entries.*
