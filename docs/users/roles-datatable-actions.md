## Users and Roles Tabs
Switch between the [Users datatable](users/user-datatable) view and the Roles datatable view.

## Export
The export icon ( ![Export Icon](../assets/export-icon.svg "Export Icon") ) will export all entries in the datatable to .xlsx file format. *Alternatively, you can select the checkbox(es) next to the row item(s) to export only the selected entries.*

## Filter
The filter icon ( ![Filter Icon](../assets/filter-icon.svg "Filter Icon") ) opens the filter options menu. Here you can use preset filters options from the dropdown menu and then type your keyword to filter the datatable. 

* To add another filter, click the **Add Filter** button below the last entry. 

* To clear all filters, click on the **Clear All** button.

## Roles Datatable Switches
The Roles datatable also features switches in the datatable row items to enable **read-only (RO)** or **read-write (RO)** access to each individual section of this application per given role.
