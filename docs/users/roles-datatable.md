The **Roles datatable**, under the Roles tab, displays the roles from your [RingCentralÂ®](https://ringcentral.com) account and associated permissions they have regarding their access to [IVR Orchestrator](https://ivrorchestrator.ps.ringcentral.com). The datatable displays information about each role found in your account, if that roles has access to IVR Orchestrator, IVR section permission levels, IVR default media permission levels, media section access permission levels and user section access permission levels.

## Role Datatable Columns
* **Name-** the name of this user role. 
* **App Access-** shows if IVR Orchestrator access is enabled or disabled for the role.
* **IVR Access-** read-write or read-only access permissions for the IVR section of the app.

* **Media Access-** read-write or read-only access permissions for the Media section of the app.

A list of all roles present in your RingCentral account is automatically populated into the roles section. Permissions can be set for each existing role.

The built-in super admin role is hardcoded with permanent RW access to avoid the potential of accidentally getting locked out. *A user with a* **super admin** *role on the RingCentral account must perform the initial role-enablement for other users of this application.*
