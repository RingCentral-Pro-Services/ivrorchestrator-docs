## Editing Role Permissions

A list of all roles present in your [RingCentralÂ®](https://ringcentral.com) is automatically populated in this section for easy role access enablement and permissioning. You may grant **read-only (RO)** or **read-write (RW)** access to each individual section of this application and to any given role in your RingCentral account.

## Enable App Access for a Role

To enable access to [IVR Orchestrator](https://ivrorchestrator.ps.ringcentral.com) for non-super admin roles, you must engage the first switch, **App Access** for the role you wish to give access.

1. Find the Role you want to give app access to.
2. Engage the **App Access** switch to enable and allow users of that role type to login to app.
3. When **App Access** is enabled the first time, the role will default to **RO or read-only** access by default.

Pease note that the built-in RingCentral super admin role is hardcoded with permanent **RW access** to avoid the potential of accidentally getting locked out. *A user with a* **super admin** *role on the RingCentral account must perform the initial role-enablement for other users of this application.*

## RO or Read-only Access

By default, when you engage the **App Access** switch, the role will be given **RO, or read-only** permissions for each section by default. This will allow the users of that role type to login and see the data, but are unable to edit it.

* RO is read-only access or view mode. The users of the role type cannot make any edits if RO is enabled for that section of the app.

## RW or Read-write Access

If you wish to give users of a given role **edit permissons**, simply flip the associated permission switch to **RW, or read-write** for that section of the app. 

To deliver full app access for a role type, change all switches to the **RW option**. This role type will now have full application access and can edit any section of the app.

* RW is read-write or edit mode. Users of that role type can change settings in that section of the app.
